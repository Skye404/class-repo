I'm studying Technical Communication and Rhetoric at USU. I taught seventh grade English for four years before pursuing my master's. I'm interestsed in editing and techincal communication for future careers, but I could see myself going back to teaching at some point.

I'm a complete noob at web development. I've edited HTML code only slightly when I taught virtually during Covid.

I TAed during my undergrad, and I taught secondary English for four years.

I hope to be able to learn the basics and vocabulary so that I can apply practical skills to my own work. I'm interested in being able to design websites for academic and business purposes.

Smile, pretend like you know what's going on, and always have chocolate in your pocket. (This is a Skye original.)
